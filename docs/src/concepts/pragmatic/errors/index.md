# Error Index

This page lists errors produced by the solver.


## E0xxx Error

Errors from E0xxx range are generic.


### E0000

`cannot deserialize problem` is returned when problem definition cannot be deserialized from the input stream.


### E0001

`cannot deserialize matrix` is returned when routing matrix definition cannot be deserialized from the input stream.


### E0002

`cannot create transport costs` is returned when problem cannot be matched within routing matrix data passed.

There are two options to consider, when specifying routing matrix data:

- *time dependent VRP* requires all matrices to have `profile` and `timestamp` properties to be se
- *time agnostic VRP* requires `timestamp` property to be omitted, `profile` property either set or skipped for all matrices


### E0003

`cannot find any solution` is returned when no solution is found. In this case, please submit a bug and share original
problem and routing matrix.


### E0004

`cannot read config` is returned when algorithm configuration cannot be created. To fix it, make sure that config has
a valid json schema and valid parameters.


## E1xxx: Validation errors

Errors from E1xxx range are used by validation engine which checks logical correctness of the rich VRP definition.


### E11xx: Jobs

These errors are related to `plan.jobs` property definition.


#### E1100

`duplicated job ids` error is returned when `plan.jobs` has jobs with the same ids:

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "jobs": [
      {
        "id": "job1",
        /** omitted **/
      },
      {
        /** Error: this id is already used by another job **/
        "id": "job1",
        /** omitted **/
      }
      /** omitted **/
    ]
  }
}
```

Duplicated job ids are not allowed, so you need to remove all duplicates in order to fix the error.


#### E1101

`invalid job task demand` error is returned when job has invalid demand: `pickup`, `delivery`, `replacement` job types should
have demand specified on each job task, `service` type should have no demand specified:

```json
{
  "id": "job1",
  "deliveries": [
    {
      /** omitted **/
      /** Error: delivery task should have demand set**/
      "demand": null
    }
 ],
 "services": [
   {
     /** omitted **/
     /** Error: service task should have no demand specified**/
     "demand": [1]
   }
 ]
}
```

To fix the error, make sure that each job task has proper demand.


#### E1102

`invalid pickup and delivery demand` error code is returned when job has both pickups and deliveries, but the sum of
pickups demand does not match to the sum of deliveries demand:

```json
{
  "id": "job",
  "pickups": [
    {
      "places": [/** omitted **/],
      "demand": [1],
    },
    {
      "places": [/** omitted **/],
      "demand": [1]
    }
  ],
  "deliveries": [
    {
      "places": [/** omitted **/],
      /** Error: should be 2 as the sum of pickups is 2 **/
      "demand": [1]
    }
  ]
}
```


#### E1103

`invalid time windows in jobs` error is returned when there is a job which has invalid time windows, e.g.:

```json
{
  /** Error: end time is one hour earlier than start time**/
  "times": [

      "2020-07-04T11:00:00Z"
    ]
  ]
}
```

Each time window must satisfy the following criteria:

* array of two strings each of these specifies date in RFC3339 format. The first is considered as start,
the second - as end
* start date is earlier than end date
* if multiple time windows are specified, they must not intersect, e.g.:

```json
{
  /** Error: second time window intersects with first one: [13:00, 14:00] **/
  "times": [
    [
      "2020-07-04T10:00:00Z",
      "2020-07-04T14:00:00Z"
    ],
    [
      "2020-07-04T13:00:00Z",
      "2020-07-04T17:00:00Z"
    ]
  ]
}
```


#### E1104

`reserved job id is used` error is returned when there is a job which has reserved job id:

```json
{
  /** Error: 'departure' is reserved job id **/
  "id": "departure"
}
```

To avoid confusion, the following ids are reserved: `departure`, `arrival`, `dispatch`, `break`, and `reload`. These
ids are not allowed to be used within `job.id` property.


#### E1105

`empty job` error is returned when there is a job which has no or empty job tasks:

```json
{
  /** Error: at least one job task has to be defined **/
  "id": "job1",
  "pickups": null,
  "deliveries": []
}
```

To fix the error, remove job from the plan or add at least one job task to it.


#### E1106

`job has negative duration` error is returned when there is a job place with negative duration:

```json
{
  "id": "job",
  "pickups": [
    {
      "places": [{
        /** Error: negative duration does not make sense **/
        "duration": -10,
        "location": {/* omitted */}
       }]
       /* omitted */
    }
  ]
}
```

To fix the error, make sure that all durations are non negative.


#### E1107

`job has negative demand` error is returned when there is a job with negative demand in any of dimensions:

```json
{
  "id": "job",
  "pickups": [
    {
      "places": [/* omitted */],
      /** Error: negative demand is not allowed **/
      "demand": [10, -1]
    }
  ]
}
```

To fix the error, make sure that all demand values are non negative.


### E12xx: Relations

These errors are related to `plan.relations` property definition.

job ids, not present in `plan.jobs`.


#### E1201

`relation has vehicle id which does not present in the fleet` error is returned when `plan.relations` has relations with
vehicle ids, not present in `plan.fleet`.


#### E1202

`relation has empty job id list` error is returned when `plan.relations` has relations with empty `jobs` list or it has
only reserved ids such as `departure`, `arrival`, `break`, `reload`.


#### E1203

`strict or sequence relation has job with multiple places or time windows` error is returned when `plan.relations` has
strict or sequence relation which refers one or many jobs with multiple places and/or time windows.

This is currently not allowed due to matching problem.


#### E1204

`job is assigned to different vehicles in relations` error is returned when `plan.relations` has a job assigned to several
relations with different vehicle ids:

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "relations": [
      {
        "vehicleId": "vehicle_1",
        "jobs": ["job1"],
        /** omitted **/
      },
      {
        /** Error: this job id is already assigned to another vehicle **/
        "vehicleId": "vehicle_2",
        "jobs": ["job1"],
        /** omitted **/
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To fix this, remove job id from one of relations.


#### E1205

`relation has invalid shift index` error is returned when `plan.relations` has `shiftIndex` value and no corresponding
`shift` is present in list of shifts.


#### E1206

job id and corresponding property on `fleet.vehicles.shifts` is not defined. Reserved ids are `break`, `dispatch`, `reload`
and `arrival`.


#### E1207

`some relations have incomplete job definitions` error is returned when `plan.relations` has relation with incomplete
job definitions: e.g. job has two pickups, but in relation its job id is specified only once. To fix the issue, either
remove job ids completely or add missing ones.

* amount of total locations is higher than matrix size

Check locations in problem definition and matrix size.


#### E1505

`unknown matrix profile name in vehicle or vicinity clustering profile` is returned when vehicle has in `fleet.vehicles.profile.matrix`
or `plan.clustering.profile` value which is not specified in `fleet.profiles` collection. To fix issue, either change

### E16xx: Objectives

These errors are related to `objectives` property definition.


#### E1600

`an empty objective specified` error is returned when objective property is present in the problem, but no single
objective is set, e.g.:

```json
{
  "objectives": []
}
```

`objectives` property is optional, just remove it to fix the problem and use default objectives.


#### E1601

#### E1603

`redundant value objective` error is returned when objectives definition is overridden with `maximize-value`, but
there is no jobs with non-zero value specified. To fix the issue, specify at least one non-zero valued job or simply
delete 'maximize-value' objective.


#### E1604

`redundant tour order objective` error is returned when objectives definition is overridden with `tour-order`, but
there is no jobs with non-zero order specified. To fix the issue, specify at least one job with non-zero order or simply
delete 'tour-order' objective.


#### E1605

`value or order of a job should be greater than zero` error is returned when job's order or value is less than 1. To
fix the issue, make sure that value or order of all jobs are greater than zero.
