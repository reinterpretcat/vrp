# Unassigned jobs

When job cannot be assigned, it goes to the list of unassigned jobs:

```json
{{#include ../../../../../examples/data/pragmatic/basics/unassigned.unreachable.solution.json:113:123}}
```

Each item in this list has job id, reason code and description.


## Reasons of unassigned jobs

| `MAX_DISTANCE_CONSTRAINT`       | `cannot be assigned due to max distance constraint of vehicle` | allocate more vehicles?                                 |
| `SHIFT_TIME_CONSTRAINT`         | `cannot be assigned due to shift time constraint of vehicle`   | allocate more vehicles?                                 |
| `BREAK_CONSTRAINT`              | `break is not assignable`                                      | correct break location or/and time window?              |
| `LOCKING_CONSTRAINT`            | `cannot be served due to relation lock`                        | review relations?                                       |
| `AREA_CONSTRAINT`               | `cannot be assigned due to area constraint`                    | make sure that jobs inside allowed areas                |
