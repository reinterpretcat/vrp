# Multiple trips

These examples demonstrates how to use vehicle reload feature which is designed to overcome vehicle capacity limitation
in order to perform multiple trips (tours).

Essentially, reload is a place where vehicle can unload `static` pickups and load new `static` deliveries. Here, static
correspond to `static demand` concept which is defined via standalone pickup or delivery jobs, not by single pickup and
delivery job.

## Same location reload

In this scenario, once some jobs are delivered, the vehicle returns to the original depot to load next goods.

## Multiple reloads with different locations

In this scenario, vehicle picks goods and flushes them on two different locations during single tour. This can be used
to model _waste collection_ use case.

## Shared reload resource

In this scenario, there are two vehicles with limited capacity `[2]` with reload which has shared resource constraint `[1]`.
The problem has 6 delivery jobs in total.

    <summary>Problem</summary><p>

```json
{{#include ../../../../../examples/data/pragmatic/basics/reload.resource.problem.json}}
```

</p></details>

As result, the solution has 5 jobs assigned and one is unassigned as there is not enough capacity and reload resource
constraint doesn't allow to reload more than 1 delivery in total for all vehicles.
