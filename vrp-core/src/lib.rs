//! A core crate contains main buildings blocks for constructing heuristics and metaheuristic
//! to solve rich [`Vehicle Routing Problem`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem).
//!
//! # Key points
//!
//! A basic idea of the core crate is to design a library which can be used to solve multiple
//! variations of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) known also as a rich VRP. In order to achieve that,
//! it defines essential domain models and implements default metaheuristic with preconfigured
//! properties.
//!
//! Another goal is an intuitive design: it should be relatively easy to start using it without prior
//! knowledge of the domain. That's why the API design does not try to generalize models and
//! implementations in order to develop a general purpose metaheuristic.
//!
//!
//! Extra functionality, already developed on top of this crate, is available via following crates:
//!
//! - `vrp-scientific` crate supports VRP variations used in scientific benchmarks
//! - `vrp-pragmatic` crate supports custom json format which can be used to model real world scenarios
//! - `vrp-cli` crate provides a command line interface and static library with all available functionality
//!   provided by the project
//!
//! Meanwhile, the project tries to keep the list of dependencies relatively small, but "Not invented HERE"
//! syndrome should be also avoided.
//!
//! The next sections explain some basic concepts such as types used to model VRP definition,
//! constructive heuristics, metaheuristic, etc. Start exploring them, if you are curious about
//! internal implementation or library extension. It you are looking just for user documentation,
//! check! the [`user guide`] documentation.

//! # Modeling VRP
//!
//! Model definitions can be split into three groups:
//!
//! - [`common`] group contains common models: time-specific, location, distance, etc.
//! - [`problem`] group contains VRP definition models: job, vehicle, cost-specific, etc.
//! - [`solution`] group contains models which used to represent a VRP solution: route, tour, activity, etc.
//!
//! Check corresponding modules for details.
//!
//! [`common`]: ./models/common/index.html
//! [`problem`]: ./models/problem/index.html
//! [`solution`]: ./models/solution/index.html
//!
//!
//! # Constructive heuristic
//!
//! A constructive heuristic is a type of heuristic method which starts with an empty solution and
//! repeatedly extends it until a complete solution is obtained.
//!
//! The crate implements various constructive heuristics in [`construction`] module.
//!
//! [`construction`]: ./construction/index.html
//!
//!
//! # Metaheuristic
//!
//! A metaheuristic is a high-level algorithmic framework that provides a set of guidelines or strategies
//! to develop heuristic optimization algorithms. One of its goals is to guide the search process towards
//! optimal solution.
//!
//! See more details about it in `solver` module.
//!
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The most simple way to run solver is to use `Builder`. You can tweak metaheuristic parameters by
//! calling corresponding methods of the builder instance:
//!
//! ```
//! # use vrp_core::models::examples::create_example_problem;
//! # use vrp_core::solver::get_default_telemetry_mode;
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! use vrp_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! // create your VRP problem
//! let problem = create_example_problem();
//! let environment = Arc::new(Environment::new_with_time_quota(Some(10)));
//! let telemetry_mode = get_default_telemetry_mode(environment.logger.clone());
//! // build solver config to run 10 secs or 1000 generation
//! let config = create_default_config_builder(problem.clone(), environment, telemetry_mode)
//!     .with_max_time(Some(10))
//!     .with_max_generations(Some(10))
//!     .build()?;
//! // run solver and get the best known solution within its cost. Telemetry metrics are ignored.
//! let (solution, cost, _) = Solver::new(problem, config).solve()?;
//!
//! assert_eq!(cost, 42.);
//! assert_eq!(solution.routes.len(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(solution.unassigned.len(), 0);
//! # Ok::<(), String>(())
//! ```
